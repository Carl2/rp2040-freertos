* FreeRtos for Rp2040


First all it seems to be working fairly well



* Commands


** building
#+begin_src bash
  mkdir build && cd build
  cmake ..
  make -j8
  # This will complain about ucHeap For some reason it tries to use
  # head_4 Running "cmake .." again will provide the right cmake Args to
  # build process of freertos.
  cmake ..
  make -j8
  # this should work.
#+end_src

** Using openocd with cmisis-dap (picoprobe)

This will upload the elf to /rp2040/
#+begin_src bash
  make ocd_flash
#+end_src

** Debug
There are two different ways of debugging (using /openocd/).
The first will open a tmux and provide both openocd and gdb output.

Console:
#+begin_src bash
  make debug
#+end_src

gdbgui:
#+begin_src bash
  make gui_debug
#+end_src





#+end_src
